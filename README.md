# ophyd_async

Asynchronous Bluesky hardware abstraction code, compatible with control systems like EPICS and Tango

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

|   Releases    | <https://github.com/bluesky/ophyd-async/releases> |

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from ophyd_async import __version__

print(f"Hello ophyd_async {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m ophyd_async --version
```
