We should also document the various permutations of TriggerInfo and provide any common helpers like the one defined in #401. The cases we need to document:

    trigger=internal, livetime=deadtime=None: Internal trigger mode, with exposure and period untouched. The default for trigger() if prepare() not called
    trigger=any, livetime=float: Exposure set to livetime and period set to livetime+get_deadtime(livetime)
    trigger=any, livetime=float, deadtime=float: Exposure set to livetime and period set to deadtime
    num=0: Go until disarmed, if detector supports it
    num=+ve: Arm for this many frames
