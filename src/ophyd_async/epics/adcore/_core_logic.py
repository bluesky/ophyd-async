        The driver to start acquiring. Must subclass ADBaseIO.

    Start acquiring driver, raising ValueError if the detector is in a bad state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    driver:
        The driver to start acquiring. Must subclass ADBaseIO.
    good_states:
        set of states defined in DetectorState enum which are considered good states.
    timeout:
